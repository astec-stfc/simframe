The Accelerator Simulation Framework
====================================

The **Accelerator Simulation Framework** otherwise known as **SimFrame** is a ``python`` package for performing start-to-end (S2E) simulations of linear particle accelerators.

It provides a wrapper for several well-known particle tracking codes:

* `ASTRA <https://www.desy.de/~mpyflo/>`_
* `GPT <https://www.pulsar.nl/gpt/>`_
* `Elegant <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator-Operations-Physics/Software#elegant>`_
* `CSRTrack <https://www.desy.de/xfel-beam/csrtrack/>`_

The primary use for SimFrame has been for simulating the `CLARA <https://www.astec.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/CLARA.aspx>`_ particle accelerator.
